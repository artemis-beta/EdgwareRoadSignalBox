# Edgware Road Signal Cabin

![Edgware Road Frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artemis-beta/EdgwareRoadSignalBox/master/EdgwareRoadFrame.png)

This is an alpha release of a signal box simulation based on the former London Underground Edgware Road signal cabin which ceased operation in August of 2019 as part of Transport for London's plans to upgrade signalling on the Circle Line by 2021. Currently the simulation is in stage one, with levers and interlocking present. The simulation is constructed using the Qt 5.14 framework.

The plan for the future is to continue building onto this including features such as train describers and ultimately adding in actual services. 

## Operation

All signals and points are labelled on the track diagram.

Levers 1 to 12 control westbound signals, with the exception of lever 9 which is out of service. Lever 10 controls departure from Edgware Road siding, Lever 8 reverse movement into Edgware Road from the east.

Levers 13 to 27 control points, with the exception of levers 24 and 25 which are emergency levers (more info needed on this).

Levers 28 through to 38 control signals in the eastbound direction. Lever 32 controls reverse movement into Edgware Road from the west.

As development progresses more information will be made available within this document, for now, enjoy playing around with the levers and signals!

## Your Help and Advice

If you or someone you know have information concerning operation of Edgware Road signal box please DO contribute by raising a suggestion in the issues for this repository. A lot of this simulation has been pieced together from images and videos so accuracy to the original cannot yet be guaranteed.
